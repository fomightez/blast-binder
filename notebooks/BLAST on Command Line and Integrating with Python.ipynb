Or, if you feel more confortable working on the actual command line, you can open a terminal from within this active Jupyter environment by clicking the Jupyter logo in the upper left corner of this notebook and then selecting `New` > `Terminal` form the dropdown on the right of the Jupyter environment dashboard and run the initial parts without the `!` or `%%bash` tags.)\n",

And even more pertinent for dealing with BLAST results in Jupyter notebooks, there is actually an easier way to interact with this script when in Jupyter notebook that skips saving this intermediate file. Please see the next notebook on using BLAST results with Python for more about that if you find that awkward. To lessen the Python wizardry for now, I am going to take the file intermediate path, and perhaps I should have saved it in a tab-separated form, but that would take up more space and some of these files can get rather large. It is easy to convert back and forth using the pickled form assuming you can match the Pandas/Python versions.

As you'll see, the dataframe structure makes it easy to keep these combined, but easily accessible individually.
