Please see the next notebook on using BLAST results with Python for more about that if you find that awkward. To lessen the Python wizardry for now, I am going to take the file intermediate path, and perhaps I should have saved it in a tab-separated form, but that would take up more space and some of these files can get rather large. It is easy to convert back and forth using the pickled form assuming you can match the Pandas/Python versions.

As you'll see, the dataframe structure makes it easy to keep these combined, but easily accessible individually.
